# Password Generator
A password generator and GUI built with Python/Tkinter.

Running the main file will initialize the GUI by default. \
`> PasswordGenerator.init()`

The generator function can also be accessed independently by importing the class. \
`> PasswordGenerator().generate_password(standalone=True)`

Enjoy!
